# The Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

> The single responsibility principle declares that a class should only be responsible for a single functionality. The above also refers to modules and functions.

# The Open-Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle requires that classes should be open for extension and closed to modification.

> The core idea of the above principle is that we should be able to add new functionalities without changing the existing code.

# The Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

> Replacing an instance of a class with its child class should not produce any negative side effects

# The Interface Segregation Principle

Segregation means keeping things separated, and the Interface Segregation Principle is about separating the interfaces.

> A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn’t use, or clients shouldn’t be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

# The Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion principle states that our classes should depend upon interfaces or abstract classes instead of concrete classes and functions.

> Entities must depend on abstractions, not on concretions. It states that the high-level module must not depend on the low-level module, but they should depend on abstractions.
